Running tests with AppEngine is problematic. "go test" only seems to
run with a real go installation, not the appengine one. Furthermore,
running tests with "go test" won't work in the normal directory
because the non-appengine go command gets confused by the unknown
appengine packages. Therefore we have to set up a directory with just
the files needed for testing.

When running tests, GOROOT must point to the non-appengine go root.

Tests should be run with "go test ./testing".
